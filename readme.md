### Customisation

An `assets` folder will be created when you create a new `.Rmd` file from templates. Simply replace the image in the folder, or even change the color scheme in the css file to make your own style!


### Notes

Since different styles may use different numbers of assets (logos, background images, etc.), so generally one can't switch between styles seamlessly. To try out different styles, one creates a new `.Rmd` file and copies/pastes the content over.
